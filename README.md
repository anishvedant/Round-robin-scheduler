# Round-robin-scheduler

This Python project simulates a thread scheduler using Round Robin scheduling with priority. It provides insights into thread scheduling information and performance metrics.

## Key Features
- Thread Scheduling: Implements Round Robin scheduling with priority to manage thread execution.
- Performance Metrics: Calculates throughput, CPU utilization, average turnaround time, average waiting time, and average response time.
- Suspension and Resumption: Allows suspension and resumption of threads for dynamic scheduling.

## Setup Instructions
Clone the Repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/scheduler_simulation.git
```
Navigate to the directory:

```bash
cd scheduler_simulation
```

## Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install threading
```

## Execute the Script

Open Command Prompt by pressing Win + R and typing cmd.
Navigate to the directory where the script is saved using the cd command.
Execute the script by typing python scheduler_simulation.py in the Command Prompt and pressing Enter.

## Follow the Output

Review the output displayed in the Command Prompt window.
Follow the output for thread scheduling information and performance metrics.

# Usage
Run the Script:

```bash
python3 scheduler_simulation.py
```

# Review Output:

The script will simulate thread scheduling with round-robin scheduling and display performance metrics such as throughput, CPU utilization, average turnaround time, average waiting time, and average response time.
