# Round-robin-scheduler

This Python project simulates a thread scheduler using Round Robin scheduling with priority. It provides insights into thread scheduling information and performance metrics.

## Key Features
- Thread Scheduling: Implements Round Robin scheduling with priority to manage thread execution.
- Performance Metrics: Calculates throughput, CPU utilization, average turnaround time, average waiting time, and average response time.
- Suspension and Resumption: Allows suspension and resumption of threads for dynamic scheduling.

## Setup Instructions
Clone the Repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/scheduler_simulation.git
```
Navigate to the directory:

```bash
cd scheduler_simulation
```

## Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install threading
```

## Usage
Execute the script:

bash
Copy code
python scheduler_simulation.py
Follow the output displayed in the Command Prompt window for thread scheduling information and performance metrics.
